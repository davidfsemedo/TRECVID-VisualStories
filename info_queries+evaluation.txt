################################ Stories and Segments #########################################


For each event, Story topics and corresponding segments can be found in JSON files:
	- edfest_2016_stories.json
	- tourfrance_2016_stories.json
	
For test topics, the topics/queries from both events are released in a single JSON file:
	- edfest+tourfrance_2017_stories.json


Each JSON has the event(s) name(s) ("event_name") and an array ("stories") with all the stories. Each story entry has:
	- "story_title": The title of the story
	- "story_id": The ID of the story
	- "segments": An array of segments

Each segment entry has:
	- "segment_id": The ID of the segment
	- "text": The segment's text
	- "keywords": The segment's text keywords


Example file:
{
	"event_name": "Edinburgh Festival 2016",
	"stories": {
		"story_title": "Edinburgh Castle is one of the main attractions",
			"story_id": 1,
			"segments": [
				{
					"segment_id": 1,
					"text": "Deep time Show",
					"keywords": "Deep time Show"
				},
				{
					"segment_id": 2,
					"text": "Fireworks",
					"keywords": "Fireworks"
				},
				{
					"segment_id": 3,
					"text": "Beautiful streets of Edinburgh with its castle on the background",
					"keywords": "Edinburgh streets and castle"
				},
				{
					"segment_id": 4,
					"text": "People enjoying Edinburgh Castle clear blue sky",
					"keywords": "People and Edinburgh Castle with blue sky"
				}
			]
		},
		...
}



#################################### Run Submission File ######################################

Submission files follow the standard TREC submission files format. Therefore, each file should have the following format:

run_id query_id dummy doc_id
0 1.1 dummy 760513155030220800
0 1.2 dummy 768780028783972352
0 1.3 dummy 784357358524915713
0 1.4 dummy 767349865886130176
...


Where the first line is the header.
Each of the remaining lines should contain the following fields, separated by a white space:
	- run_id (defined by participants)
	- query_id: Each query is a string of the form <story_id>.<segment_id> (the query_id 2.3 corresponds to the illustration of segment 3 of story 2)
	- a dummy value
	- doc_id: The Tweet ID of the image/video assigned to illustrate the segment
	
NOTE: Each submission file must contain an entry/line for each query ID.


Check our Git Repository (https://github.com/davidfsemedo/TRECVID-VisualStories/tree/master/evaluation) 
to learn how to verify and evaluate your submission file using the evaluation script.

Examples of submission files can be found at (https://github.com/davidfsemedo/TRECVID-VisualStories/tree/master/evaluation/runs).



#################################### Groundtruth ##############################################

Groundtruth is defined on two files:
	- (1) Relevance of an image/video to a segment 
	- (2) Transition between assigned images/videos of two consecutive segments 

For each event(s) you will find two .csv (a comma ',' is used as delimiter) files:
	- <event_name>_relevance_groundtruth.csv (1)
	- <event_name>_transitions_groundtruth.csv (2)



On both files, the first line is the header with column names.

Each line of file (1) has the form: query_id,doc_id,rel
	- query_id: ID of the query (<story_id>.<segment_id>);
	- doc_id: The Tweet ID of the image/video;
	- rel: Relevance of the image/video to the query (0 for non-relevant, 1 for relevant).


Each line of file (2) has the form: query_id,doc_id1,doc_id2,trans
	- query_id: ID of the query (<story_id>.<segment_id>);
	- doc_id1: The Tweet ID of the first image/video;
	- doc_id2: The Tweet ID of the second image/video;
	- trans: Quality of the transition (0 for bad, 1 for good).
NOTE: The transition is from doc_id1 to doc_id2 images/videos





#################################### Evaluation ###############################################

The evaluation computes a score that corresponds to the Quality metric described in the Guidelines document. 
Concretely it assesses two criteria:

- Relevance of each assigned image/video to a segment;
- Quality of transitions between an assigned image/video of consecutive segments.

For a detailed explanation of the metric, please refer to the Social-media Video Storytelling Linking Task Guidelines  document available on the TRECVID task webpage.
Each event is evaluated separately. 


EVALUATION SCRIPT: An evaluation script is provided in our Git repository.
