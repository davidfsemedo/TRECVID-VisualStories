TWITTER VISUAL STORIES DATASET

For Convenience, we provide a set of pre-computed features that you may optionally use.

List of Provided Features for IMAGES:

* CNN ResNET-50 features from a pre-trained network on ImageNET:
	- Extracted from the penultimate layer, after Average Pooling
	- Dimension 2048
	- Non-normalized
	- Available for both events, and both 2016 and 2017 editions. Files:
		-- SPAM not Filtered:
			--- edfest_2016_model-resnet50-avg_pool_dim-2048_non-normalized.hdf5
			--- tourfrance_2016_model-resnet50-avg_pool_dim-2048_non-normalized.hdf5
			--- edfest_2017_model-resnet50-avg_pool_dim-2048_non-normalized.hdf5
			--- tourfrance_2017_model-resnet50-avg_pool_dim-2048_non-normalized.hdf5
		-- SPAM Filtered:
                        --- edfest_2016_nospam_model-resnet50-avg_pool_dim-2048_non-normalized.hdf5
			--- tourfrance_2016_nospam_model-resnet50-avg_pool_dim-2048_non-normalized.hdf5
			--- edfest_2017_nospam_model-resnet50-avg_pool_dim-2048_non-normalized.hdf5
			--- tourfrance_2017_nospam_model-resnet50-avg_pool_dim-2048_non-normalized.hdf5


Features are provided in HDF5 files (Please check https://support.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/examples/ for tutorials and terminology - Dataset, Group, etc.). Format:
	- Attributes:
		-- total_images: Total images (#I)
		-- feat_description: A brief textual description of the feature
	- Datasets:
		-- descriptors: An array with shape #I x D, where #I denotes the number of images and D the feature dimensionality;
		-- available_images: An array of size #I. Consists of a mask indicating which images were successfully downloaded and processed. For images which were not available (marked as 0), the corresponding entry of the "descriptors" array is filled with nan's;
		-- image_tweet_id: An array of utf-8 formatted strings of size #I. Contains the tweet id of each image (e.g. image_tweet_id[0] is the tweet id of the image with descriptor descriptors[0]).

List of Provided Features for VIDEOS:

* CNN ResNET-50 features from a pre-trained network on ImageNET:
	- Features are extracted from frames, sampled from every 2 seconds of a video
	- Extracted from the penultimate layer, after Average Pooling
	- Dimension 2048
	- Non-normalized
	- Available for both events, for 2017 editions only. Files:
		-- SPAM not Filtered:
			--- edfest_2017_videos_model-resnet50-avg_pool_dim-2048_non-normalized.hdf5
			--- tourfrance_2017_videos_model-resnet50-avg_pool_dim-2048_non-normalized.hdf5
		-- SPAM Filtered:
			--- edfest_2017_nospam_videos_model-resnet50-avg_pool_dim-2048_non-normalized.hdf5
			--- tourfrance_2017_nospam_videos_model-resnet50-avg_pool_dim-2048_non-normalized.hdf5

Features are provided in HDF5 files (Please check https://support.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/examples/ for tutorials and terminology - Dataset, Group, etc.). Format:
	- Attributes:
		-- total_videos: Total videos (#V)
		-- feat_description: A brief textual description of the feature
	- Datasets:
		-- available_videos: An array of size #V. Consists of a mask indicating which videos were successfully downloaded and processed. For videos which were not available (marked as 0), the corresponding entry of the "descriptors" array is filled with nan's;
	- Groups -> One for each video. The key is the video index (e.g. f[0] is the group of video 0):
		-- video_tweet_id: Contains the tweet id of this video (UTF-8 formatted string);
		-- num_feature_frames: Number of frames #F for which features were extracted;
		-- Datasets:
			--- descriptors: An array with shape #F x D, where #F denotes the number of sampled frames and D the feature dimensionality;
